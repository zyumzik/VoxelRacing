# VoxelRacing
![Main menu](https://github.com/zyumzik/VoxelRacing/blob/main/mm.jpg)
  Hi! This is my first game made on Unity. I've never loved racing games, but really enjoyed casual mobile games like 'Crossy Road', so wanted to make my own casual 
voxel race. By the way, as you can see, graphics I painted a bit similar to 'Crossy Road', especially colour palette. That was my first project, so take care of your
eyes while reading).

  In VoxelRacing you need to drive through the infinity generating world as long as you can, collecting coins for buying new vehicles, evadeing traps and another cars!
World is generating with pre-made chunk templates. Some of chunks contains couple of cars, which follow their own trajectory. From time to time random dudes try to
pass the crosswalks, you can smash them to get extra coins! Do not forget about pits, arranged along the road because you can loose one of your hit points if get into it.
Addition hearts can be found on roads, like coins. 
  If you've collected enough coins there are few cars available for buying in main menu! Every car has it's own mobility, speed and basic amount of hearts. 
(FOR TEST: in main menu click on the coin image to get more coins, try another vehicle).

  P.S. My record is 23.57! Will you beat it?
